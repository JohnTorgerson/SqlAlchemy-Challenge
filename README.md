##### Instructions:
Create file `config.py` to pass your user name, password, and port number into variables
This code will not run unless you first configure the following three variables:
* user = "postgres"
* password = "<YOUR PostgreSQL Password HERE>"
* port = "<Your PostgreSQL Port Number HERE>"
---
    
##### Tools and Supplies:
* < Database and table description here >

* Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, Matplotlib; SQLAlchemy ORM session queriies were made from SQLite data

### Guide to Repo Contents:

* `climate_starter.ipynb` is < describe contents >
* `abc.png` is < describe image >
* In folder, `Resources` are the following 6 tables:
    1. `hawaii.sqlite` is a database of precipitation measurements at 9 stations
    2. `hawaii_measurements.csv` is a table of precip measurements over time from all stations
    3. `hawaii_stations.csv` is a table of geographic stations where the measurements were taken
    4. `Precipitation.png` is a plot of precipitation values over the most recent year
    5. `tobs_year.png` is a histogram showing time of observation changes over the most recent year

### Observations:
* < List Observations Here >
* The relationship is inverse.
* Engineer, Asst Engineer, Senior Engineer have similar AVG Salaries, with Senior Engineers making the least of the group. Meanwhile Senior Staff as well as general Staff, both AVG nearly 12,000 more. Also, from our previous examples, there are an awful lot of women named Hercules B____, which seems improbable.
* Either something is wrong, or this company data is fictional.
